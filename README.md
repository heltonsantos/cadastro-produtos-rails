## Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        $ gem install rails

2. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:

        $ rails new myapp

   where "myapp" is the application name.

3. Change directory to `myapp` and start the web server:

        $ cd myapp
        $ rails server

   Run with `--help` or `-h` for options.

4. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see:
"Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!"
